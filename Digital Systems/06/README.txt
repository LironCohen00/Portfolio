Objective:
Write an Assembler program that translates programs written in the symbolic Hack assembly language into binary code that can execute on the Hack hardware platform built in the previous projects.

When loaded into your assembler, a Prog.asm file containing a valid Hack assembly language program should be translated into the correct Hack binary code and stored in a Prog.hack file.

Usage:
Depending on the programming language that you use, the assembler should be invoked using "Assembler fileName.asm", where the string fileName.asm is the assembler's input, i.e. the name of a text file containing Hack assembly commands. The assembler creates an output text file named fileName.hack. Each line in the output file consists of sixteen 0 and 1 characters. The output file is stored in the same directory of the input file. The name of the input file may contain a file path.
