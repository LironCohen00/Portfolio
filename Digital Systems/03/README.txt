Objective

Build all the chips described in Chapter 3 (see list below), leading up to a Random Access Memory (RAM) unit. The only building blocks that you can use are primitive DFF gates, chips that you will build on top of them, and chips described in previous chapters.


Chip Name	Description	
DFF		Data Flip-Flop (primitive)	
Bit		1-bit register	
Register	16-bit register	
RAM8		16-bit / 8-register memory	
RAM64		16-bit / 64-register memory	
RAM512		16-bit / 512-register memory	
RAM4K		16-bit / 4096-register memory	
RAM16K		16-bit / 16384-register memory	
PC		16-bit program counter
